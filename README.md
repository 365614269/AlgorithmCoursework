 - Mommy what does hyper mean
 - The teacher says I'll never read
 - Says I need to take a pill
 - So I can learn to sit real still
 - The microwaves did something to our brains
 - We need to take these pills to help us change

 - Please let me take them
 - I don't want to be an idiot
 - Ritalin will make me smart
 - At least that's what my teacher says
